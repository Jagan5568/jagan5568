Blind assistance systems play a crucial role in facilitating the mobility and independence of visually impaired individuals. This paper presents a novel approach to enhancing blind assistance systems through real-time object detection and distance estimation. Leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and advanced computer vision techniques, our system provides live object recognition, spatial audio alerts, and distance estimation to assist blind users in navigating their surroundings safely and effectively. The proposed system utilizes a combination of hardware components and software algorithms to achieve accurate object detection and distance estimation in real time. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed system in assisting visually impaired individuals in various environments.
